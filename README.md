# SkillLink Services Project

## Company Name
SkillLink Services Inc.

## Company Description
SkillLink Services Inc. is a service-based company that connects skilled workers such as mechanics, electricians, plumbers, and technicians with customers who require on-demand or scheduled services. The company manages service requests, worker assignments, payments, and reporting through a centralized system.

## Problem Definition
Skilled workers lack a centralized platform, customers struggle to find reliable services, and payments are poorly documented. Manual processes lead to inefficiencies and lack of transparency.

## Proposed Solution
Develop a Service Workforce Management System (SWMS) that integrates service booking, job tracking, payments, commission computation, and reporting.

## System Purpose
To digitize business processes, centralize payments, ensure transparent worker compensation, and provide management reporting.

## Target Users
- Company Owner
- Administrator
- Cashier / Finance Staff
- Skilled Workers
- Customers
- Developers

## Business Processes
1. Customer Service Request
2. Job Assignment & Execution
3. Payment Processing (Cash & E-Wallet)
4. Commission-Based Worker Payout
5. Reporting & Monitoring

## Payment Model
Customers pay the company. The company deducts a commission from labor fees and pays workers through scheduled payouts.

## Architecture
The system follows a 3-Tier Architecture consisting of Presentation, Application, and Data layers.

## Conclusion
The proposed system demonstrates proper system integration, clear business processes, and scalable architecture suitable for a capstone project.
